# goCLI

**goCLI** is a modular CLI tool written in **Go**. It is designed to support a flexible plugin system, allowing users to extend functionality with **Python** and **PowerShell** plugins. All plugins are community-generated, making goCLI highly adaptable to different use cases.

> [!NOTE]
> Note: We have temporarily dropped support for JavaScript plugins due to issues with Otto and goCLI's code structure.

## üîå Plugins

Plugins in goCLI are user-generated code snippets that interact seamlessly with the goCLI environment. They allow users to add custom features and functionality, making goCLI highly customizable. goCLI provides a simple way to install plugins via its native **[Plugin Library](https://github.com/LewdLillyVT/goCLI/wiki/Plugin-Library)**, where community members can submit their own plugins for review and potential inclusion.

The plugin review process ensures a high standard of quality and security. However, users and developers can also manually add plugins locally, thanks to goCLI's structured folder system.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

Upon first run, goCLI will create a new directory at `/LOCALAPPDATA/goCLI` with the following subfolders:

- **logs**: Stores error logs for debugging purposes.
- **plugins**: Stores downloaded plugins. Users can also add their own plugins directly to this folder.
- **dependencies**: For future implementation of javascript or other languages.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

On a fresh Windows installation, goCLI will only support PowerShell plugins. To unlock full functionality:

1. **Install Python 3** to enable Python plugins.

Ensure that both Python and NPM are added to your system PATH.

Thank you for using goCLI! We hope this tool and the contributions from the community make goCLI an invaluable addition to your toolkit.
